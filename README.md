# Two-three tree

An educational project for working with 2-3 trees. Each operation’s time complexity is O(n). The code is based on a teacher’s template so some of its elements may not correspond to the latest coding rules.

# 2-3 tree definition

In computer science, a 2–3 tree is a tree data structure, where every node with children (internal node) has either two children (2-node) and one data element or three children (3-nodes) and two data elements. A 2–3 tree is a B-tree of order 3. Nodes on the outside of the tree (leaf nodes) have no children and one or two data elements.
